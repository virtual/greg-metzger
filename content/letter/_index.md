# Letter to the Editor: Bozeman Daily Chronicle

<small>October 9, 2018</small>

I am running for the Gallatin County Clerk and Recorder. I am a Navy veteran and have more than 35 years of management experience.

I have been a volunteer in many organizations including, the Boy Scouts, Rotary, Chamber of Commerce, MSU School of Business, Gallatin County Planning Board and Compensation Committees, along with other organizations. I believe in our community and I am ready to serve in a public position.

My management skills have been honed leading an international company with over 600 employees, Montana Furniture with more than 135 employees, and other management positions. I started my career as an Industrial Engineer for Boeing-which expanded my experience in systems and flow management.

As our county grows and expands, we need to analyze how we perform in government and ensure that we are engaging technologies that will help reduce costs, improve efficiencies and accuracy. As we look towards the future, more residents means more ballots, and these increases will require changing methodsâ€”while meeting state laws and achieving today's near flawless accuracy.

The Recorders Office has embraced technology but needs to be ready for growth. Volume naturally affects customer service and we need to ensure we are measuring, and challenging our current standards.

My belief in our county and democratic systems are the major factor in running for this position. Our county is founded on principles-which are adhered to by individual voters coming together to move our county in a direction the majority desires. Voting must be accurate, timely and accountable for democracy to flourish and prosper.

My honesty, integrity and work ethic, combined with my team building skills and management experience, make me the right person for this position. I ask for your vote.
